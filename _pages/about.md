<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


My name is Tongkang Zhang (张同康), and I recently completed my Ph.D. in Control Theory and Control Engineering at [Northeastern University](http://www.neu.edu.cn), where I conducted my research at the [State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industry](http://www.sapi.neu.edu.cn) (PI: Prof. Tianyou Chai, Co-PI: Prof. Jinliang Ding), with [Prof. Jinliang Ding](http://www.ise.neu.edu.cn/2024/0603/c213a256332/pagem.htm) as my Ph.D. supervisor. Before I joined State Key Laboratory of SAPI, I obtained my Master's degree and Bachelor's degree in Control Engineering from Northeastern University（NEU, China）in 2017 and 2015, with [Prof. Mingxing Jia](http://www.ise.neu.edu.cn/jsml/1125.html) as my M.Eng. supervisor and [Prof. Jinkuan Wang](http://www.ise.neu.edu.cn/2020/0425/c6129a168963/page.htm) as my B.Eng supervisor. 

My research interests lie in the fault diagnosis and root cause analysis, industrial big data visualization (VIS) and visual analytics systems techonolgy (VAST), and intelligent industrial software design. My research aim to apply visual analytics, learning-based algorithms, and data analysis techniques to process monitoring, fault diagonsis, and production decision-making on complex industrial process, covering essential domains such as deep learning-based modeling, industrial big data analytics, and intelligent industrial software design.
